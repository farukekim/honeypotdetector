Honeypot Checker for BSC, ETH, AVAX, FTM, POLYGON Network

What is a crypto honeypot and why is it used?
Honeypots are smart contracts that appear to have a design issue that allows an arbitrary user to drain Ether (Ethereum's native currency) from the contract if the user sends a particular quantity of Ether to the contract beforehand. However, when the user tries to exploit this apparent flaw, a trapdoor opens a second, yet unknown, preventing the ether draining from succeeding. So, what does a honeypot do?

The aim is that the user focuses entirely on the visible weakness and ignores any signs that the contract has a second vulnerability. Honeypot attacks function because people are frequently easily deceived, just as in other sorts of fraud. As a result, people cannot always quantify risk in the face of their avarice and assumptions. 

How do I check if the token is honey pot or not?
We had develop a [honeypot checker tool](http://detecthoneypot.com) for detecting scam projects. It is a [honeypot detector](http://detecthoneypot.com) for BSC, ETH, AVAX, FTM, POLYGON Network!

How does it work? 

Honeypot detector simulates a buy and a sell transaction to determine if a token is a honeypot.
